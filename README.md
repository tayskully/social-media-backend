# Social Media Backend

[![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

## A fully functioning backend for your next social media platform!

I wanted to create an easily usable backend that establishes a user base, can establish friends relationships, can add posts (called Thoughts), and where people can react to Thoughts with Reactions.

Maybe a build my own social media next!

## Installation

In order to check this application out, you will need to have a coding application and run an npm i for the packages necessary.

## Usage/Tests

Once you're set up in the coding application of your choice, run node index.js in the terminal to start the server. When the server is started, you can make calls through insomnia to see how the data reacts.
You can create a user, add friends, remove friends, add thoughts, react to those thoughts, and see which data is related to which user. Enjoy!
